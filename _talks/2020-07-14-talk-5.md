I was one of a handful of awardees who received the Expanding Horizons Travel Grant award from the American Association of Physicists in Medicine, which is designed to provide trainees travel support to conferences that are not specifically geared toward medical physics, an effort to broaden the scope of scientific meetings attended and potentially spark novel, interdisciplinary research directions. The award supported my attendance at the NeurIPS conference in 2019. This ePoster presentation and discussion session at the AAPM annual meeting was a report-back session for the awardees to share their experience at the various conferences that we were funded to attend.
