🌟 I gave a Rising Star spotlight talk at the the University of Chicago Center for Data and Computing (CDAC) Rising Stars in Data Science Workshop (video recordings will be published online soon). Humbled to be among the inaugural cohort of Data Science Rising Stars!

💡 My abstract “Role of standard and soft tissue chest radiography images in COVID-19 diagnosis using deep learning” was recently presented the SPIE Medical Imaging conference! Oral presentation in February and proceeding paper are available online.

🎉 My proceeding paper corresponding to the above-mentioned abstract won 2 awards at the SPIE Medical Imaging 2021 conference: runner-up of the Computer-Aided Diagnosis Paper Award and runner-up of the Robert F. Wagner All-Conference Best Student Paper Award!
