I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Medical Physics](https://medphys.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago, working in the computer-aided diagnosis group directed by [Dr. Maryellen Giger](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/maryellen-l-giger-phd). I am passionate about transforming healthcare with technology and using artifical intelligence to accelerate scientific discoveries. My thesis research is focused on developing artifical intelligence methods, including deep learning and conventional radiomics, for quantitative medical image analysis to assist in clinical decision-making. I have worked on breast cancer diagnosis using state-of-the-art multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I have been working on establishing large-scale chest radiography and computed tomography databases and leveraging medical images to enhance the early detection and prognosis of COVID-19. I love working in this interdisciplinary field at the intersection of physics, medicine, computer science, and statistics, conducting research profoundly impactful to human lives. 

Prior to graduate school, I graduated with honors from Carleton College, where I double majored in Physics and Mathematics. I had a wide range of undergraduate research experiences, including human and model observer studies for lung cancer screening computed tomography at Mayo Clinic, low-dimensional electronic devices at MIT, optical photopolymer at Carleton, and noise analysis for LIGO gravitational wave detection at Carleton.

In addition to science and technology, I love traveling the world to experience different cultures, going hiking to embrace nature, cooking for family and friends, and reading up on art history.
