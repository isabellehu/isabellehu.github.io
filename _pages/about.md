I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Medical Physics](https://medphys.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago, working in the computer-aided diagnosis group directed by [Dr. Maryellen Giger](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/maryellen-l-giger-phd). I am passionate about transforming healthcare with technology and using artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discoveries. My thesis research is focused on developing artificial intelligence methods, including deep learning and conventional radiomics, for quantitative medical image analysis to assist in clinical decision-making. I have worked on breast cancer diagnosis using state-of-the-art multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, I have also been working on establishing large-scale chest radiography and computed tomography databases and leveraging medical images to enhance the early detection and prognosis of COVID-19. I love working in this interdisciplinary field at the intersection of physics, medicine, computer science, and statistics, conducting research profoundly impactful to human lives. 

In addition to my thesis research, I have also worked on a wide range of interesting course projects, including cancer drug response prediction using genomics data, caption generation for histopathology images, toxic online comment identification, network intrusion detection, training a reinforcement learning agent to play Pac-Man, satellite image segmentation, and more.

Prior to graduate school, I graduated with honors from Carleton College, where I double majored in Physics and Mathematics. I had a wide range of undergraduate research experiences, including human and model observer studies for lung cancer screening computed tomography at Mayo Clinic, low-dimensional electronic devices at MIT, optical photopolymer at Carleton, and noise analysis for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) at Carleton.

Outside of work, I love traveling the world to experience different cultures, going hiking to embrace nature, cooking with family and friends, and reading up on art history. I also invest my time in advocating for, mentoring, and creating communities for women in science and technology.
