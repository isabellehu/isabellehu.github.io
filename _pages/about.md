I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Medical Physics](https://medphys.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago, working in the computer-aided diagnosis group directed by [Dr. Maryellen Giger](https://radiology.uchicago.edu/faculty/maryellen-l-giger-phd). I am passionate about transforming healthcare with technology and using artifical intelligence to accelerate scientific discoveries. My thesis research is focused on developing artifical intelligence methods, including deep learning and conventional radiomics, for clinical decision-making based on medical images. I have worked on breast cancer diagnosis using state-of-the-art multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. My current project leverages medical images to perform the early detection and prognosis of COVID-19.

Prior to graduate school, I graduated with honors from Carleton College, where I double majored in Physics and Mathematics. I had a wide range of undergraduate research experiences, including human and model observer studies for lung cancer screening computed tomography (at Mayo Clinic), low-dimensional electronic devices (at MIT), optical photopolymer (at Carleton), and noise analysis for LIGO gravitational wave detection (at Carleton).

In addition to science and technology, I love traveling the world to experience different cultures, going hiking to embrace nature, cooking for family and friends, and reading up on art history.
